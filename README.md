# animated-garbanzo

## 1. Project overview
`animated-garbanzo` is the repository for this project. At the moment, no application source files or service configuration are present in the repository root beyond this README, so the runtime behavior and feature set are not yet documented.

## 2. Prerequisites
> **Maintainer TODO (toolchain not yet defined):** Replace this placeholder with the exact required versions once the project stack is finalized.

- Git `>= 2.40`
- **Runtime:** _TBD (for example: Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)_
- **Package manager/build tool:** _TBD_

## 3. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd animated-garbanzo
```

> **Maintainer TODO (dependency install command not yet defined):**
>
> Add the exact dependency install command for the chosen stack, for example one of:
>
> - `npm ci`
> - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
> - `go mod download`

## 4. Running locally
> **Maintainer TODO (start command not yet defined):**
>
> Add the exact command contributors should run to start the app/service locally.
>
> Example format:
>
> ```bash
> <start-command>
> ```

## 5. Testing
> **Maintainer TODO (test command not yet defined):**
>
> Add the required validation commands contributors must run before opening a pull request.
>
> Example format:
>
> ```bash
> <test-command>
> <lint-command>
> ```

## 6. Project structure
Current repository contents:

- `README.md` — Project documentation and onboarding instructions.

> **Maintainer TODO:** Expand this section as directories/files are added (for example `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, etc.).

## 7. Contributing
Until project-specific workflows are defined, use the following baseline process:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
   ```
2. Make focused, atomic commits with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "feat: describe change"
   ```
3. Run all required tests/lint checks (see **Testing**).
4. Open a pull request that includes:
   - A concise summary of what changed.
   - Test evidence (commands run + results).
   - Any follow-up TODOs or known limitations.

## 8. License
License TBD.
